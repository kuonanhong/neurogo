Portfolio Website on the Go
===========================

I always learn a new language by re-creating my simple
static website in that language; this time, I'm learning Go.

Go has peaqued my interest primary because of its support for Google,
its benchmarks (http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/), and the utilization
of goroutines (https://gobyexample.com/goroutines).  Having worked with
Python for awhile now, I've grown to enjoy coroutines for parallelization and
concurrency as an alternative to callback hell
(http://elm-lang.org/learn/Escape-from-Callback-Hell.elm).
